# bittensorVanityWalletGenerator
Generate vast amounts of vanity wallets quickly to pick from

# Step 1. Run the generator

`python3 generateWallets.py`

Wallets are printed to console and their key/mnemonics are stored in results.txt

# Step 2. View the generated mnemonics

Open `results.txt` with your favorite/safest editor to view the mnemonics that create the wallets you've generated.  Ideally one that does not keep history (like notepad or something)

# Step 3. View your vanityDex

`python3 vanityDex.py`
